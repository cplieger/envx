# envx

[![Go Reference](https://pkg.go.dev/badge/github.com/cplieger/envx/v2.svg)](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/cplieger/envx/v2) [![Go version](https://img.shields.io/github/go-mod/go-version/cplieger/envx)](https://github.com/cplieger/envx/blob/main/go.mod) [![Mutation](https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cplieger/envx/badges/mutation.json)](https://github.com/cplieger/envx/issues?q=label%3Agremlins-tracker)

envx configures your Go app from environment variables and Docker secrets, with typed getters that fall back to your defaults and log a typo instead of hiding it.

It replaces the `os.Getenv`, `strconv` and `KEY_FILE` code a service otherwise writes at startup. The root module depends only on [pathinside](https://github.com/cplieger/pathinside), which uses only the standard library. The optional yamlenv module adds [go-yaml](https://github.com/yaml/go-yaml) v3 for YAML config files. Both need Go 1.27.1 or later and are licensed under Apache-2.0.

## Why use it

envx is built for Go services in containers, configured by compose or Kubernetes through variables and mounted secret files.

- `Bool`, `Int` and `Duration` return your default for an unset, empty or malformed value. A malformed one also logs a warning through `slog.Default()` naming the variable.
- A key name no variable can have, such as `APP LISTEN`, panics on first read. Otherwise the getter would return its default forever.
- `Require` returns a typed error, so startup can report every missing variable at once.
- `Secret` reads `KEY_FILE` before `KEY`, caps the file at 1 MB and keeps the secret out of every error and log line.
- yamlenv fills `${VAR}` in a YAML config file after parsing it, so a value cannot change its structure. `Load` errors never carry an expanded value by default.

Consider [caarlos0/env](https://github.com/caarlos0/env) if you want your whole config parsed into a tagged struct, with float, slice, map and custom-type parsers.

## Install

```sh
go get github.com/cplieger/envx/v2@latest
```

yamlenv is a separate module with its own version tags:

```sh
go get github.com/cplieger/envx/yamlenv/v2@latest
```

## Usage

Read each setting with its default:

```go
addr := cmp.Or(envx.String("APP_LISTEN"), ":8080")
debug := envx.Bool("APP_DEBUG", false)                 // true/1/yes/on · false/0/no/off
retries := envx.Int("APP_RETRIES", 3)
interval := envx.Duration("APP_INTERVAL", 6*time.Hour) // Go duration syntax
```

Fail at startup on a missing variable, and read a Docker secret from `APP_API_KEY_FILE` when it is set, else from `APP_API_KEY`:

```go
token, err := envx.Require("APP_TOKEN") // *envx.MissingError when unset or empty
if err != nil {
	slog.Error("startup", "error", err)
	os.Exit(1)
}

// An empty APP_API_KEY_FILE names no file, so Secret would read APP_API_KEY
// instead. Stop here when a broken secret mount must not fall back:
if envx.IsBlankSecretFilePath("APP_API_KEY") {
	slog.Error("startup", "error", "APP_API_KEY_FILE is set but empty")
	os.Exit(1)
}

apiKey, err := envx.Secret("APP_API_KEY")
```

Keep a `run(os.Args, os.Getenv)` test seam and still get the typed getters:

```go
func main() { os.Exit(run(os.Args, os.Getenv)) }

func run(args []string, getenv func(string) string) int {
	env := envx.Source{Get: getenv}
	timeout := env.Duration("DUMP_TIMEOUT", 5*time.Minute)
	workers := env.Int("DUMP_CONCURRENCY", 2)
	// ...
}
```

Load a YAML config file whose values refer to environment variables as `${VAR}`. `Load` checks, parses, expands and decodes in one call. With its default options, every error it returns is safe to log:

```go
cfg := defaultConfig() // the decode overlays the file onto your defaults
allow := func(name string) bool { return strings.HasPrefix(name, "APP_") }
unresolved, err := yamlenv.Load(data, &cfg, allow)
if len(unresolved) > 0 {
	slog.Warn("config references unset environment variables",
		"vars", strings.Join(unresolved, ","))
}
if err != nil {
	return err // a misspelled key, a second document or a decode failure, with no secret in the text
}
```

[YAML config files with yamlenv](docs/yamlenv.md) covers the expansion rules, the steps `Load` runs and `WithErrorPassthrough`, which returns the decode errors you select unchanged. The runnable examples on pkg.go.dev show more cases, and `go test` keeps them true.

## API

- Getters: `String`, `Bool`, `Int` and `Duration`, which take the variable name as a `Key`.
- Strict getters that return a malformed value as an error and never log: `BoolStrict`, `IntStrict`, `DurationStrict` and `ParseError`.
- Required values and secrets: `Require`, `Secret`, `SecretWithSource`, `IsBlankSecretFilePath`, `MissingError` and one error value for each way a secret file can fail.
- An injected environment: `Source`, which carries the getters, the strict getters and `Require` as methods.
- yamlenv: `Load` with its options, and the steps it runs, `Expand`, `SanitizeDecodeError`, `CheckUnknownKeys` and `CheckSingleDocument`.

## Behavior contract

- Every getter treats an empty variable as unset. Use `os.LookupEnv` when the difference matters.
- A value never causes a panic or an exit. The one panic is a malformed key name, which comes from the code.
- A tolerant getter and its strict variant share one parser, so they accept exactly the same values.
- `Bool`, `Int`, `Duration` and the strict getters trim surrounding whitespace. `String` returns the value as set.
- `Secret` returns `KEY` as set, and a file's content with at most one trailing line ending removed.
- envx keeps no state, starts no goroutines and reads the environment only when a getter is called.

[Behavior contract](docs/behavior.md) has every rule, including the secret-file checks and the error values.

## Unsupported by design

These are deliberate non-goals:

- Struct tags or reflection-based config loading.
- Loading `.env` files.
- Float, slice and map getters.
- Prefix namespacing such as `WithPrefix("APP_")`.
- `MustX` variants that panic on a missing variable.
- Accepting a malformed key name with a warning.

[Non-goals](docs/non-goals.md) gives the reason for each.

## Documentation

- [Behavior contract](docs/behavior.md) explains how each getter treats unset, empty and malformed values, and how secrets are read.
- [YAML config files with yamlenv](docs/yamlenv.md) covers `${VAR}` expansion, the `Load` pipeline and its options.
- [Non-goals](docs/non-goals.md) gives the reason each unsupported feature is left out.
