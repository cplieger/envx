import "strconv"

// Key is the NAME of an environment variable — "APP_LISTEN", never its value.
// Every getter in this package takes its key as a Key.
//
// The type states the role, and its validation catches a malformed name. What
// it deliberately no longer carries is the old key/fallback transposition
// story: [String] takes no fallback, and the parsing getters' fallbacks are
// typed (bool, int, time.Duration), so no getter in this package has two
// adjacent parameters a caller could swap. That hazard is closed by the
// signatures, not by this type.
//
// What the type does buy, in two layers:
//
//   - At compile time it guards VARIABLE-passing sites: a plain string
//     variable in a key position does not compile. Untyped literals still
//     convert implicitly, so existing literal call sites are unaffected — the
//     type alone was never the guard, which is why the signatures had to carry
//     it.
//
//   - At run time, first use validates the spelling: a Key that is not an
//     environment-variable name ([A-Za-z_][A-Za-z0-9_]*, and never empty)
//     PANICS, naming the offending string. This catches a typo ("MY VAR",
//     "app.listen") and a badly built dynamic name, both of which would
//     otherwise read as a permanently unset variable and return a default
//     forever. It is the regexp.MustCompile class: a programmer error at a
//     usually-literal call site, deterministic from the first read.
type Key string

// keyEchoMax bounds the quoted key an invalid-name panic echoes. A dynamically
// built name can be long or carry a value fragment, so 64 bytes names the
// mistake without echoing the whole thing.
const keyEchoMax = 64

// validate panics when k is not an environment-variable name. Every getter
// calls it before reading anything, so the panic surfaces at the first use of
// the malformed key — at startup, where config code runs — rather than as a
// silently wrong value. The message names the offending string, which is a
// compile-time constant from the call site rather than operator data.

// quoteCapped returns strconv.Quote(s), or — when that is longer than limit
// bytes — the quote of the longest leading run of s that still fits with a
// trailing ellipsis inside the closing quote. limit is assumed to be at least 5,
// the width of the shortest truncated form.
//
// The cut is made on s and the quoting redone; it is never a byte slice of the
// quoted string. Cutting the quoted form at an arbitrary byte lands inside an
// escape sequence ("\xf" out of "\xff", which is no longer a Go literal) or
// inside a multi-byte rune, and the panic message is both read by a person and
// carried into a log store, so invalid UTF-8 there is a defect in two ways.
// Re-quoting each candidate prefix runs only on the panic path, and the loop
// stops at the first prefix that does not fit, so it costs nothing that matters.

// what a kernel or POSIX tolerates (POSIX asks applications to TOLERATE odd
// names; os.Setenv accepts "a.b" and "a b") — the fleet writes only this
// grammar, and the narrowness is what makes a typo detectable instead of
// silently unset. A plain byte loop rather than a regexp — validation runs on
// every getter call, and the grammar is ASCII-only by definition, so byte
// inspection is exact.
